The only good one would be the Knight Compendium, but it’s more a list of tricks than a tutorial (some of the stuff in here will be taken from it, and I still recommend giving it a read). Considering we’re going to have many new players that will come with F2P (if any of you are reading this, are from EU and want to train/1v1 with me - dm bunnie#8671 or deynarde#4491 on Discord!), me and deynarde (the creator of the Compendium) decided to write this guide. We hope it will help many of you. We’re going to cover everything; getting better on all levels, playing on CTF, dealing with high ping, dealing with bugs. It may seem like a lot, but knight combat is very rich, and if you really want to get better, then this will be perfect for you. "],

It’s pretty much the ‘main’ class of the game; in a good team in CTF (the main gamemode - capture the flag) or TTH (take the halls) 75% players should be playing Knight, and in TDM (team deathmatch) it’s the most played class as well. As a knight in CTF and TTH, your role will be helping the team advance forward to get the enemy flag/enemy hall, but before you learn more about gamemodes and playing in a team, let’s talk about the combat mechanics first.
