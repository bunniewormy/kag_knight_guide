\chapter{Introduction}\label{introduction}

hehe homek god

I've read many tutorials on both the game's forums and the Steam
community hub, and 90\% of them, if not more, were either bad or
outdated. The only good one would be the
\href{https://deynarde.github.io/kag-knight-compendium/}{Knight
Compendium}, but it's more a list of tricks than a tutorial (some of the
stuff in here will be taken from it, and I still recommend giving it a
read). Considering we're going to have many new players that will come
with F2P (if any of you are reading this, are from EU and want to
train/1v1 with me - dm bunnie\#8671 or deynarde\#4491 on Discord!), me
and deynarde (the creator of the Compendium) decided to write this
guide.

We hope it will help many of you. We're going to cover everything;
getting better on all levels, playing on CTF, dealing with high ping,
dealing with bugs. It may seem like a lot, but knight combat is very
rich, and if you really want to get better, then this will be perfect
for you.

\section{The Knight Class}\label{the-knight-class}

in KAG, the are 3 main classes: the Archer, the Builder and the Knight.
It's pretty much the `main' class of the game; in a good team in CTF
(the main gamemode - capture the flag) or TTH (take the halls) 75\%
players should be playing Knight, and in TDM (team deathmatch) it's the
most played class as well.

As a knight in CTF and TTH, your role will be helping the team advance
forward to get the enemy flag/enemy hall, but before you learn more
about gamemodes and playing in a team, let's talk about the combat
mechanics first.
